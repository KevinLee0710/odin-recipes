A recipe site that I want to use to store my favorite recipes.

To-do list

Redo the css files to have them be a single file
Re polish the code so that it looks better
Figure out how to give the recipes tags so I can make pages for recipe categories with cards that show up if the recipe matches the type you select on the main page
