A recipe site that I want to use to store my favorite recipes.

To-do list
<ul>
    <li>Redo the css files to have them be a single file</li>
    <li>Re polish the code so that it looks better</li>
    <li>Figure out how to give the recipes tags so I can make pages for recipe categories with cards that show up if the recipe matches the type you select on the main page</li>
</ul>
